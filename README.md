# Trading Risk Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Python project that calculates the potential risk of financial positions based on asset volatility and exposure.

## 📊 How It Works

The risk score is calculated using the formula:

Risk Score = Volatility × Exposure


The user provides a list of assets with associated volatility and exposure values. The script then calculates the risk score for each asset and visualizes the results in a bar chart.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Example Output

| Asset | Volatility | Exposure | Risk Score |
|-------|------------|----------|------------|
| AAPL  | 0.12       | 100,000  | 12,000     |
| TSLA  | 0.25       | 120,000  | 30,000     |
| ...   | ...        | ...      | ...        |
